There are two ciruits

1) Consumer side.
2) Electricity Department Side(present t the Distribution transformer).

Consumer Side.
---------------------------
Task: Measure rate at which power is used. If the rate exceeds a certain limit
      proving to be potentially dangerous for the distribution transformer, 
      the user has to be warned and after 3 warnings, if usage of power hasn't
      decreased, current flow has to be cut off.

How to measure Rate at which power is being used??
---------------------------------
On the meter , an led is present. It Blinks due to the generation of a certain
pulse rate when power is being consumed. We have to measure the number pulses 
per unit hour , to calculate the pulse rate. This value is to be multiplied by
a certain factor (0.3125 in our case) to determine the watts used per hour.

How did we do it?
----------------
The terminals of the the led (indiating pulses) present on the meter 
was connected to the anode and cothode pins of an octocoupler.
the collector pin of the octocoupler was given to one pin in the controller
to count the pulses.

Circuit Diagram explanation
--------------------------------
Live and Neutral .----> to PlC modem and 12v Rectifier.
Out put of rectifer---->to 5v Regulator
5v from regulator -----> Power atmega328 controller
                 -----> On board ftdi232 USB to Serial converter(programmer)
                 ----->PlC modem
                 -----> LCD Display
Atmega328 controller---> takes input from octocoupler
                   ---->Displays pulses and watts used on LCD
                   ---->when consumption of power rate has been exceeded
                       conntroller send a command to PLC modem
                     and the plc modem communicated this through power lines
                    to the PLC modem at the distribution transformer.
12v Relay------------->connected to one pin of controller, cuts the power
                       supply accordingly.

Distribution Transformer side.
-----------------------------------
consits of a PLC modem, atmega328 controller, GSM module. 
Other components include the ftdi232, 5v rectifier.
                 
when the PLC modem receives a code , when rate of power usage has been 
exceeded, the GSM is alerted to send a message to the consumer.
After two warnings , the power will get cut off.
